__ABSTRACT__
The human skin is our point of contact with the microbial world, yet little is known regarding the diversity of the skin virome. Studies of the human skin virome have focused on bacteriophage and double-stranded DNA viral genomes, however, there have been few efforts to characterize the human skin circular single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) virome. Here, we evaluate the diversity of the circular ssDNA virome collected across three anatomical skin locations from 60 human individuals with five time-point collections spanning 6 months. Our analysis resulted in the identification of 272 novel and unique Rep-encoding ssDNA viruses associated with human skin. Taxonomic frameworks using sequence similarity networks and maximum likelihood estimations of the Rep and Capsid protein amino acid sequences of Cressdnaviricota from our sequencing and public database references, reveal family level stability across the study participants and a larger host-range than previously thought for these multi-host pathogens.
